I've been been working with Drupal in Peytz &amp; Co for around 1.5 year now. I'm really getting into the whole mentality and without (hopefully) sounding too self consumed, I'm getting pretty good at it.

However there's one thing about Drupal that I haven't really touched yet - and it's a big one. <strong>The community</strong>. Well last week, I did!

Last week was the 2015 Drupalcon in Barcelona and I was going with the company I'm employed with, Peytz &amp; Co. 

<strong>I didn't know what to expect beforehand</strong> - that sums it up pretty well. I had read about DrupalCon but I still didn't quite get it.

Some people I talked to, talked about it as if it was just a circlejerk event for people that wanted to network with possible job possibilities. Others talked about it as if it was the incarnation of the Drupal and Open-source - an amazing event that people in the community should NEVER miss out on.

<strong>So how was it?</strong> it was.. nice! I found out that both camps definetly were right - a large majority of it WAS networking but it didn't feel like a negative thing.
I was shocked how many people from Denmark was there (200-300ish) and it felt really nice to be able to put a face on Drupal-Denmark.

It was also a really nice time to bond with my colleagues. I hadn't really thought about that angle earlier, but it was nice to see them in a different professional context.

However, the best part of my first DrupalCon experience was to be introduced to the whole community mindset. It was amazing to see how committed many of the speakers were to the Drupal-cause. I'm especially thinking of the ones that are not "officially" connected with the Drupal association, but still work many hours of their freetime for the cause. 

I was also surprised how open the community was - they really do go the extra mile to make sure everyone feels welcome and included - of course because being an open-source software, we can't afford to exclude people :)

<strong>So what will I take with me from my first DrupalCon experience?</strong> Well I learned some new things from the talks of course and I'll definitely see this as my start-signal to get started with Drupal8 (crossing fingers on the October date for the RC!).

But after seeing the community and see that it is not some kind of face-less entity that is running the core, I'd like to be part of that. I'd love to help where I can - both to help others, but also to make sure that Drupal takes a direction that I've been apart to shape.
