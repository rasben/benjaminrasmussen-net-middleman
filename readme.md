# A simple personal blog, made with Middleman

I wanted to create a simple blog/personal site for myself and I wanted to try something new - so I checked out Middleman.

[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) is a static site builder - meaning that the whole site needs to be recompiled every time you update a peice of content.

It was an interesting experience. I've hacked something together that suits my needs, but I know that some of it has ended up as quite a mess - especially the Grunt file. Oh well!

## I think this is an okay example of a Middleman setup
I mean, you get the point easier when you see a real-life example (Which I could find none of) - **but I really suggest you take what I've made with a grain of salt, as I've just been jumping straight into it.**

If you wanna check out the site, you'll need a few things:

- Ruby
- NodeJS / NPM
- Install the node modules (such as grunt)
- Install graphicsmagick: apt-get install graphicsmagick
- Run grunt build from the root
- I probably forgot something. Why would you wanna compile my site anyway? You can view the result here:
